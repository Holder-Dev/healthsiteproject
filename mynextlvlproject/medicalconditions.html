        <strong>Nutrition & Physical Activity:</strong><br><br>
        Poor nutrition contributes to many costly diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and some cancers (CDC, 2019). Healthy eating patterns are associated with a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, some neurological conditions, overweight, and obesity (CDC, 2017).
        Everything you eat and drink over time matters. The right mix can help you be healthier now and in the future.  Start with small changes to make healthier choices you can enjoy.
        <br><br>
        Find your healthy eating style and maintain it for a lifetime.<br>
        This means:
        <li>Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.</li>
           ○ Focus on whole fruits.<br>
           ○ Vary your veggies.
        <li>Make half your grains whole grains.</li>
        <li>Move to low-fat and fat-free milk or yogurt.</li>
        <li>Vary your protein routine.</li>
        <li>Drink and eat less sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.</li>
        <li>Drink 8-10 glasses of water per day.</li>
      </p>

        Active people generally live longer and are at less risk for serious health problems like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some cancers.
        For people with chronic diseases, physical activity can help manage these conditions and complications (CDC, 2019).

        <strong>Physical activity</strong> simply means movement of the body that uses energy. Walking, gardening, briskly pushing a baby stroller,
        climbing the stairs, playing soccer, or dancing the night away are all good examples of being active. For health benefits, <strong>physical activity</strong> should be moderate or vigorous intensity.
